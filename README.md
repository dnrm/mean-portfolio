|HTTP Client                                |The Angular HTTP Client can be found on the projects and create project pages. It was implemented as a service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|File Uploads                               |File uploads is handled using a service of its own and successfuly makes a post request to upload images. The validation is done by the backend API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|Components                                 |There are 5 main components in this application. About, Projects, Create, Details, and Contact. About shows a default lorem ipsum text. Projects lists all the projects in the database. Create has a form to create a new project. Details receives a project ID as a route parameter and displays information about the project. Finally the Contact component displays information about the author.|
|Parent to child communication and viceversa|This is done with the @Output and @Input decorators. It was removed in the final version of the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|Router                                     |Router was used in order to programmatically navigate to other routes in the event of a project being created successfully and for basic navigation using the top navbar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|Reactive Forms                             |Reactive forms was used in the Create component to validate the inputs and handle file uploads when creating a new project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
