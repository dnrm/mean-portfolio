-|Components                                 |There are 5 main components in this application. About, Projects, Create, Details, and Contact. About shows a default lorem ipsum text. Projects lists all the projects in the database. Create has a form to create a new project. Details receives a project ID as a route parameter and displays information about the project. Finally the Contact component displays information about the author.|
